# skybriefing-dabs

Automated script to download PDFs from [skybriefing.com](https://www.skybriefing.com/) and send them via email.
Uses [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) for simulating a browser, so the PDFs get created properly.

The old script runs on Python 2 and is in `py2`.

The download of the PDF has been ported to Python 3 and can be run with:

    python3 get_pdfs.py
